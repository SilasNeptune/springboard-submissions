# Springboard Data Science Project Submissions

This repository contains my data science projects as part of the Springboard coursework

## Data Wrangling

[JSON Exercises](https://github.com/SilasNeptune/springboard-submissions/blob/master/json-project.ipynb) : The dataset on the World Bank projects is available in a JSON file. This project was to gain familiarity with JSON files, converting data types and normalizing data. The goal was to discover which countries had the most projects and what categories the projects fell under.

[SQL with Mode Analytics](https://modeanalytics.com/silasnlee/reports/845747e0a884/runs/6bbe454807ce) : This report investigates the possible causes of the drop in user engagement for Yammer, a social network for coworkers to share documents, updates and ideas in group. Yammerâ€™s user engagement showed a steady increase for at least a year when all of a sudden there was a sharp decline in engagement, yet the actual signups for the service were not affected. This report explores may different reasons including email reactions, time of year, location, and devices


## Exploratory Data Analysis

[Human Body Temperature](https://github.com/SilasNeptune/springboard-submissions/blob/master/Body_temp_inferential_statistics/inferential_statistics_body_temp.ipynb) : This report explores a dataset of human body temperatures and employs the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance to find insights on average body temperature.


Racial Discrimination in US Job Market: The dataset comes from a field experiment in which researchers randomly assign identical resumes with black-sounding or white-sounding names and observe the rate of calls for interviews from employers. This exercise gives a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.

Reducing Hospital Readmissions: This report is a critique of a preliminary analysis of hospital discharge and readmission data and includes recommendations for reducing the readmissions rate. The goal is to test the rate of readmission above the predicted amount for significance and find a way to better communicate the data to reevaluate policy.
